# Simple Agent with LangChain and OpenAI

## Introduction

This repo contains a simple implementation of a chatbot using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The code is based on the ["Build an Agent"](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/agents/) LangChain tutorial, but with modifications to hit a custom API as part of the agent's tools.

The chatbot is implemented on a Jupyter Notebook (using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)) as well as a Flask application (TBA).
